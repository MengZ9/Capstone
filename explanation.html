    <section id="process">
        <p>1. First, arrange the customer satisfaction scores in ascending order. This step will help the calculation of the maximum value later.</p>
        <div id = "codeForm">
            <code id = "code"> Arrays.sort(satisfaction); </code>
        </div>

        <p>2. Initialize a variable called max and set its value to 0. Our goal is to identify dishes that produce the highest customer satisfaction. 
            This variable will hold the highest satisfaction score and will be returned at the end of the process. 
            We assume they can't be negative. Therefore, the initial max value is set to 0.</p>
        <div id = "codeForm">
            <code id = "code"> int max = 0; </code>
        </div>

        <p>3. Define a variable called time to 1 and a variable sum to 0.</p>
        <div id = "codeForm">
            <code id = "code">         int sum = 0;<br>
                int time = 1;</code>
        </div>

        <p>4. Use a nested for loop to iterate over the satisfaction score array and calculate the sum. A nested loop is necessary because, for each iteration,
             we want to exclude the elements included in the previous calculation, starting afresh from the current element.</p>
        <div id = "codeForm">
            <code id = "code">  for(int i = 0; i < satisfaction.length; i++){ <br>
                &emsp;for(int j = i; j < satisfaction.length; j++){ <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;sum += satisfaction[j] * time;<br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;time++;
                 } </code>
        </div>

        <p>5. Compare it with the current max value. Always retain the higher value between the current max and the new sum.</p>
        <div id = "codeForm">
            <code id = "code"> max = Math.max(sum, max); </code>
        </div>

        <p>6. After each iteration, reset the sum and time variables to their initial values to prepare for the next loop.</p>
        <div id = "codeForm">
            <code id = "code"> sum = 0;<br>time = 1; </code>
        </div>

        <p>7. After the loops are complete, the max variable should hold the highest satisfaction score. Return this as the final output.</p>
        <div id = "codeForm">
            <code id = "code"> return max;</code>
        </div>

        <p>1. First, arrange the customer satisfaction scores in ascending order. This step will help the calculation of the maximum value later.</p>
        <div id = "codeForm">
            <code id = "code"> Arrays.sort(satisfaction); </code>
        </div>
